# Assignment 1

This repository contains my Assignment 1 for the course SOFTENG 281: Object-Oriented Programming in Semester 1 2022.
All code in src/main/java/nz/ac/auckland/se281 with the exception of Main.java and MessageCli.java were created by me.


This project is a simple insurance system with a terminal-driven interface which allows us to:
- Add new clients,
- Delete existing clients,
- Add new policies for existing clients,
- Calculate the cost of premiums for any given policy,
- Calculate the total cost of premiums for all policies for a client,
- Applying discounts for clients who have multiple policies.
